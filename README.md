Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The purpose of this project was to choose an app idea and create it. I chose to create an event tracking app. To complete this project, I needed:
Two database tables, One for User information and one for event details. 
A login screen when I could create new users and login. 
A Grid which would populate with events unique to each user. I needed the ability to create, edit, delete, and update events within my database. 
The ability to ask for permissions to send SMS notifications.
The ability to perform said functionality based on the users granting of declining of said permission. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The required screens were:
A login Screen where the user could create new users and login with existing ones. 
A Settings screen. 
A screen populated with events.
 A screen to create events.
A screen to edit events. 
I kept users in mind by paying attention to the app layout and the size of text and buttons. I wanted to keep the design simple and easy to understand with no explanation required. I also tried to keep the number of screens minimal and made it clear what each text box required through Android Hints. I believe my design was successful because it was kept simple and intuitive. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached development though compartmentalization of requirements. I separated requirements by complexity and reliance on each other. I made sure to develop the most important things first which were needed for other parts of the app to function. I also kept in mind what the next steps were and how my current step applied to it. I believe this is a universal approach which can apply to most forms of development.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Android studio has a built-in emulator which I could use to test each feature as I created it. This process is important because it ensures each part of the app functions properly and helps avoid errors which will compromise future features. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to overcome areas of difficulty caused by lack of experience. I had no experience with SQLite, so creating databases with it was new to me. I was required to change my typical approach towards database management and make sure it worked with SQLite while also adhering to best practices. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe I was particularly successful with the creation, displaying, updating, and deleting of events. I felt my approach to this requirement built upon a lot of my past java experiences and allowed me to apply them in a new way.
